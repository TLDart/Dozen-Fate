# Multimedia Project
### Goal
To design a game using javaScript, HTML and CSS;

### Description 
Much like space Invaders, our game, Dozen fate, tells a tale of 12 people, and they fought the enemy armadas in an epic space.
To make the game creation easier we used Phaser.js
How to play the game and everything you need to know can be found on the game tab inside the game
